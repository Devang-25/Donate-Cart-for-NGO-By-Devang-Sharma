# Project title:NgoDonationApp<h1>


#### This is a website where multiple ngo admins can register their ngos.After registering their ngos they can upload their requirements.Users who are willing to donate can donate the required equipment to the ngos they want.Ngo admins can add,update or delete their requirements.Ngo admins can also uniquely identify their donors and the quantity donated. 
# Motivation: 


#### The current pandemic has caused an acute shortage of medicines, ventilators, beds and other medical equipment throughout the nation. There are NGOs trying to procure these essentials for the poor and middle class who do not have the means to purchase these things.I with my team have developed a web app where the NGOs can upload their requirements and generous users can donate the required equipment listed.

# Tech/Frameworks Used:
#### Html,Css,Javascript,Django.
